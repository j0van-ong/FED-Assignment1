# FED-Assignment1 (OCBC Website)
This is my FED assignment 1 project on a revamp of the OCBC Website. 

The redesigned website features an appealing, responsive design that is ideal for users on desktop and mobile devices. 

I priortize accessibility, offering an intuitive navigation structure that simplifies the user journey, allowing easy access to a wide range of banking services such as the Cards Page or Overview and Transfer Page when login. It is visually more appealing on the Homepage and brings the main promotions message across to them on the Homepage as well as the Cards Page. The overview page has a more meaningful side now, showing card details and breakdown of expenses. Fund Transfer is also available where users might carry out transactions on a larger screen.

## Design Process
The design is based from putting ourselves in the various perspectives of our users' goals and interests, promising that the redesigned OCBC website is an user-friendly resource for a wide spectrum of customers. 

### Target Audience
The new website aims to serves a wide range of users, including investors, companies, and individual customers. We take into account the different needs of these customer categories but overall we aim to attract the elderly with easier navigation and bigger buttons and potential new customers through the browsing of our variety of cards available to earn rewards based on their needs.

### User Stories
-As a busy professional, I want to be able to monitor my finances without wasting too much time on the internet by rapidly checking my account balance and recent transactions.

-As a small business owner, I need an easy-to-use interface to handle payroll and quickly start fund transfers so that I may effectively and trouble-free manage my company's finances.

-As a customer who wants to own a debit card at 16, I need to compare the benefits of different cards at a glance to effectively choose the one ideal for me.

-As a eldery, I need a user-friendly interface where it is easy to navigate, preferably with the help of larger icons and less clicking through link after links.
